[Easy German]("http://easygerman.org/") is a YouTube channel designed to help those learning German as a foreign language. 

Usually, videos are published roughly once a week, and last around ten minutes.

Each one exposes the learner to German used 'on the streets' and in everday life, as supposed to that taught formally in schools and universities, and comes with subtitles in English and German in the form of a transcript.

`easygerman` is a Python library for uploading these resources to Google Drive.

Easy German is a voluntary project (resources are provided for free). However, you can [donate]("https://www.patreon.com/easygerman") (starting from very small amounts, e.g $1 per month) to the creators to help finance their work.
